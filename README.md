# Git Gut: Code Dangerously

## What is it?

Want to add a little danger to your coding life? Need something to keep you on your toes during a long work day? Are you a terrible person?

If you said "yes" to any of the above, `git-gut` might be just what you were looking for.

If you accidentally type the command `gut` in your terminal instead of `git`, your intended Git command will be completely ignored. Instead, your entire repository will be wiped, and your remote repository will be deleted! It's quite a handy tool!

## Why? Just, why?

Since the letters are right next to each other, I found myself accidentally typing in `gut` when I meant to write `git`. I thought it would be funny if the `gut` command actually did something. What better thing for `gut` to do than to completely gut the repository I was working on!

## DISCLAIMER

This project is meant to be a joke. Seriously. It's incredibly dangerous. Do not use it.

I am not responsible for any accidental damage or loss of Git repository due to the usage of this command line tool.

## CHANGELOG

- 0.1.0 Initial release
